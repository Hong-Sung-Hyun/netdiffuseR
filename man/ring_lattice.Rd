\title{Ring lattice graph
Creates a ring lattice with \eqn{n} vertices, each one of degree (at most) \eqn{k}
as an undirected graph. This is the basis of \code{\link{rgraph_ws}}.}
\usage{
ring_lattice(n, k)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Integer scalar. Size of the graph.}

\item{k}{Integer scalar. Degree of each vertex.}
}
\value{
A sparse matrix of class \code{\link[Matrix:dgCMatrix-class]{dgCMatrix}} of size
\eqn{n\times n}{n * n}.
}
