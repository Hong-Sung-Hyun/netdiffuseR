# Diffusion Networks

- Unique set of studies that combine social network data with behavioral data
    - Typically have data from zero or low prevalence to saturation or high prevalence.
    - Multiple time points presents unique opportunities and challenges.
    - Models often do not include dis-adoption but can.
- Network data may be static or dynamic.
- Can have one or multiple networks
- We do not yet address multiple behaviors (e.g., tobacco & alcohol, awareness & adoption, VHS & Betamax)
- Because we combine networks and behavior
    - Can have people in the network with no adoption data
    - People with adoption data but not in the network

# Diffusion of Innovations

- Explains how new ideas and practices spread within and between communities.
- One of the oldest and richest social science theories.
- Many factors have been shown to influence diffusion
    - Spatial
    - Economic 
    - Cultural
    - Developmental
    - Biological
    - Etc.
- One of the most significant is social networks
